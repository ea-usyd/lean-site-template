**Effective altruism** is a philosophy and social movement that applies scientific evidence and logical reasoning to determine the most effective ways to improve the world. Effective altruists aim to consider all causes and actions, and then act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact. It is this broad evidence-based approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity. While many effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector, the philosophy of effective altruism applies much more broadly, e.g., to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save and improve the most lives.

We are excited to be part of a movement so rigorously focused on improving the world, and we hope youâ€™ll join us.
